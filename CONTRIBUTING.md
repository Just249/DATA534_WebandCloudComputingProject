# How to contribute

This project was made as an API wrapper for the Government of Canada [Drug Product Database (DPD)](https://hc-sc.api.canada.ca/en/detail?api=dpd). Please read through the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) before making any contributions.

## Testing

Unit tests should be written for all package functions.

## Submitting changes

Please send a GitHub Pull Request with a clear list of what you've done (read more about [pull requests](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests)). When you send a pull request, it would be great if you include examples. Please follow our coding conventions (below) and make sure all of your commits are atomic (one feature per commit).

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:
```
    $ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
    > 
    > A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."
```
